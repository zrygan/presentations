  abstract   = {A method for locating specific character strings embedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compiler is discussed. The compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an IBM 7094 program as object language. The object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and produces a signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression. Examples, problems, and solutions are also presented.},

As this interest will benefit from being informed by established contributions in this area, this paper presents a reasoned overview of central results concerning the computational complexity of natural language parsing. This overview also seeks to help to understand why, contrary to recent and widespread assumptions, it is by no means sufficient that an agent handles sequences of items under a pattern $a^n b^n$ or under a pattern $a^n b^m c^n d^m$ to ascertain ipso facto that this is the result of at least an underlying context-free grammar or an underlying context-sensitive grammar, respectively. In addition, it seeks to help to understand why it is also not sufficient that an agent handles sequences of items under a pattern $a^n b^n$ for it to be deemed as having a cognitive capacity of higher computational complexity."
